This is my first post. I am so glad because it is easy.

Actually, I have used to build Blog with Jekyll by fork other repo (I follow tutorial how to build blog in github page). It comes to mind that build blog using Jekyll is complex.

This time, I consider to blogging again -- I have wordpress blog. But with simpler UI. I think wordpress is not place for simpler UI. I want to using minimal CSS and JS.

I think I should put my other words here... But this is enough. Next time maybe I will edit this post.
